class RecordVoteOnItemView(SingleObjectMixin, View):
    """
    Records the vote casted by the current (authenticated) user on a given model instance.
    
    Note that this is an abstract view, intended to be subclassed in order to make a given 
    data model "votable". To do so, just set the ``model`` class attribute to the Django model'
    class whose instances have to be made votable.
    
    The model instance to be voted against is retrieved by the ``get_object()`` method. 
    The default implementation relies on the lookup logic provided by the built-in ``DetailView`` 
    view.
    
    After a (regular HTTP) vote request has been successfully processed, the view redirects 
    the client to the URL returned by the ``get_success_url()`` method.  
    The default implementation of  ``get_success_url()`` looks for the success URL 
    in the following places, in order:
      
      * the ``post_vote_redirect`` class attribute, if set 
      * the ``next`` parameter of the incoming HTTP request, if any
      * the ``get_absolute_url()`` method of the object returned by the ``get_object()`` method
   
   If this strategy doesn't fit your needs, just override ``get_success_url()`` in concrete subclass.
    
  If instead the vote request is performed via AJAX, a JSON object is returned to the client by the 
  ``get_json_response()`` method.  The default implementation build an object with the following properties:
    
     * ``success``: ``true`` if the vote was successfully registered, ``false`` otherwise
     * ``score``: an object having the properties ``score`` (the sum of all votes casted on the given object) 
       and ``num_votes`` (the number of votes casted on the given object)
     * ``error_message``: a message describing an error condition occurred while processing the vote
